# Flask
In this flask project, I have included a login and logout method using flask's inbuilt libraries.
And also a sign up page for collecting the user details and store them in the database to use it for the login verification.
The password given by the user is encrypted using the inbuilt hashing methods (sha256 algorithm).
When the user is logged in He/She can see a to-do list to note their works.
